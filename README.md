This small project was instructed off of the Odin Project within the Intermediate HTML/CSS Course. It composes of using CSS Grid and understanding how to use Grid. 
I somewhat understand it but this will definetely help out a lot with gaining a better understanding of Grid. 
It may not look the best nor will it more than likely function well at first, but this will help guide me a little of how grid works and help me gain a better understanding of it..
Now, feel free to comment on what looks good and what could use some improvement! 
Anything would be much appreciated.
