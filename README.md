This small project was instructed off of the Odin Project within the Intermediate HTML/CSS Course. It composes of using CSS Grid and understanding how to use Grid. 
I somewhat understand it but this will definetely help out a lot with gaining a better understanding of Grid. 
Anyways feel free to look at the site!
